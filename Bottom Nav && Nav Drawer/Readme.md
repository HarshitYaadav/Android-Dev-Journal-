# Drawer and Bottom Navigation Android App

Welcome to the **Drawer and Bottom Navigation Android App** repository! This project showcases your proficiency in Android development by implementing both a Navigation Drawer and Bottom Navigation View.

## Features

- **Navigation Drawer:** Explore categories such as Prime, Fashion, Electronics, Fresh, Beauty, and Furniture via the side navigation drawer.
- **Bottom Navigation View:** Switch between Home, Profile, Cart, and Menu fragments using the Bottom Navigation Bar.
- **Fragment Management:** Seamlessly transition between different screens through efficient fragment management.
- **Design Implementation:** Enhance the app's visual appeal with menu resource files for both bottom navigation and navigation drawer menus.

## App Processes

- **Navigation Drawer:** Access the drawer by swiping from the left edge or tapping the menu icon in the toolbar. Explore and select categories.
- **Bottom Navigation:** Use the bottom navigation bar to switch between Home, Profile, Cart, and Menu fragments.
- **Floating Action Button (FAB):** The FAB triggers an action, demonstrating additional interactivity.

## Concepts Learned

- **Navigation Drawer Implementation:** Utilized `NavigationView` and `onNavigationItemSelected()` to create and handle the navigation drawer.
- **Bottom Navigation View Integration:** Incorporated `BottomNavigationView` with menu resources, allowing easy navigation.
- **Fragment Management:** Managed fragments using `FragmentManager` and `FragmentTransaction` for smooth screen transitions.
- **Design Principles:** Created menu resource files to define bottom navigation and navigation drawer menus, improving the app's visual appeal.
